Development Guide
-----------------
This projects tries to adhere the coding guidelines listed below, please make
sure to follow them:

* `Oracle Java Language Specification`_
* `Google Java Style Guide`_

As Oracle does not provide a new style guide we follow the one from Google,
though with two expections: Indentation are 4 spaces long and consist of tabs
and lines should be wrapped after 80 characters. Otherwise it's just painful to
view the code on smaller screens.
